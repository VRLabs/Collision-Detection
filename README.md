## How it works

* A particle dies on collision with colliders, causing contacts to stop contacting each other, causing a boolean to enable.

## Install guide

https://github.com/VRLabs/Collision-Detection/assets/76777936/f9e0b70a-c5ff-43a6-a0ad-b7a3e49f3a63

* Merge the Animator Controller ``Collision Detection FX`` to your own FX Controller, using the [Avatars 3.0 Manager](https://github.com/VRLabs/Avatars-3.0-Manager) tool.
* Drag & drop the ``Collision Detection`` prefab into the base of your Hierarchy.
* Right click and unpack the prefab, then drag & drop it onto your avatar.
* Parent Constrain it to any object in your avatars hierarchy as needed.
  * Note: You can move the object as well, but you'd have to repath the animations. One tool for this is [hfcred's Animation Repathing tool](https://github.com/hfcRed/Animation-Repathing)

> [!NOTE]  
> When building for Quest, you will have to remove unsupported components and shaders

## How to use

* After parent constraining/moving the object as needed, you can scale the object to obtain the desired range.
  * Note: To change the collision requirements, you can change the Layers in the `collision` module, or disable the `collision` module and enable the `triggers` module to select specific trigger colliders.

There are three important bools in your FX Controller:

* ``CollisionDetection/IsColliding``: Whether or not the component is currently colliding with a collider.
* ``CollisionDetection/AlwaysReset``: Whether or not IsColliding should go to false immediately after stopping collision, or stay on until the Reset bool is enabled.
* ``CollisionDetection/Reset``: If ``CollisionDetection/AlwaysReset`` is false, this bool is used to reset the IsColliding state.
